# face_detection

I made a face detection classifier which detects the face and differentiates it by forming a rectangualr block.

-Language used-Python

-Tools used-OpenCV

I have tried to explain the objects I used in the OpenCV libray with comments

If you are not working on a online platform then you need to install OpenCV using pip-

Here's the command you need to run to install this libray-

pip install opencv-python 

You also need to have the haarcascade frontal face default xml file which is a file which contains all the features of a face it is provided by OpenCv. 
You will find the file in this repository.

After this you should be good to run the code.
